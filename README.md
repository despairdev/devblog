This is a simple multi-user blog/cms using Nestjs angular and react
![stack](bin/despair.png "Architecture")
I'm currently using multiple service from the aws stack such as:
* Lambda for calls to the consul endpoint to know the location of other services
* Lightsail to host my servers :(It was a cheap way to get the project started and i can always upgrade to ECS later)
* RDS for user and post data persistence: I wanted to avoid a NoSQL db
    * The data structure is mostly consistent
     * i wanted to avoid redundancy
     * it's easier for organizing and visualizing data
 * I may add Dynamo or something else if i start dealing with data from unstructured sources 
 * S3 for static site hosting
 * r53 and Cloudfont as DNS service and cdn 
      
The architecture right now, is a bit of a mess, so it is subject to change
